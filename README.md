CSC311 is the introductory machine learning course taught at UofT, where we use various python packages to implement the popular machine learning algorithm
and proving their correctness.

CSC311 Course Description:
This course is a broad introduction to machine learning.  It will start with basic methods of regression and classification and problems of over fitting and 
the evaluation of learning algorithms, and then move on to more sophisticated methods such as neural networks.
Besides reinforcing what you learn in class, the homework assignments will extend your Python skills and introduce you to the basics of scientific programming,
data visualization and computational statistics, all of which are ubiquitous in machine learning. 
As a fringe benefit, you will also find out what all that math you learned is actually used for!

Materials taught in CSC311:
Python (Numpy,Scipy,sklearn)
Linear/Logistic regression
K-Nearest-Neighbours(KNN)
Neural Network
K-Means
Expectation Maximization(EM)
Decision trees
Principle-Component-Analysis(PCA)
